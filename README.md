# BookMark'd

![Image of Logo](public/images/logo.png)

BookMark'd is an organization app to keep track of all of the things a user reads online. Users can sort the things they are reading, have completed, or want to read.

I made this app because I read a lot of fanfiction and it's hard to keep track of what I've started reading or not since things can be multi-chaptered and plot summaries can sound similar. 

## Installation

1. Clone down the repo 
git clone hhttps://github.com/rsnasraty/BookMarkd
2. cd into BookMarkd
3. npm install 
4. npm start to open up the app in your local host server
5. run your json-server
